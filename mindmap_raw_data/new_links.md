Traditional ray-tracing algorithms only render ~10%, kind of a "rough sketch", and then a generative model fills in the rest of fine details. In one forward pass. In real time. AI is the new graphics, ladies and gentlemen.

Pragmatically, we can say that AGI is reached when it's no longer easy to come up with problems that regular people can solve (with no prior training) and that are infeasible for AI models. Right now it's still easy to come up with such problems, so we don't have AGI.
