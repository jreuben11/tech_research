For those who haven't come across it yet, here's a handy trick to discuss an entire GitHub repo with an LLM:

=> Just replace "github" with "gitingest" in the url, and you get the whole repo as a single string that you can then paste in your LLMs

New research shows that LLMs don't perform well on long context.

Perfect needle-in-the-haystack scores are easy—attention mechanisms can match the word. When you require 1-hop of reasoning, performance degrades quickly.

This is why guaranteeing correctness for agents is hard.
